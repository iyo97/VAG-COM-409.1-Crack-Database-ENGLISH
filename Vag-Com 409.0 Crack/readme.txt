For sucessful operation of VAG-COM 409.1 

Simply put the .sql LITE and .meta folders into your installation directory ....
so your vag-com will have all the codes it needs to scan your vehicle.... by the 
way the 6mb vag-com uses sql injections for the .exe to get code via .xml meta file 
that is the middle man that communicates with the executable... 

whoever designed this style of injection scripting defiently know the power of 
 website building ... b/c the hack is structured in this fashion.
